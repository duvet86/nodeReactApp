# nodeReactApp

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/duvet86/nodeReactApp.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

- Install nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/, you'll get npm as well;
- Save repo files in a folder and run 'npm install' from it;
- Check package.json for scripts
  or just type in a console from the folder 'npm start' for the dev environment
  or 'npm run start:prod' for production.
  
Cheers
